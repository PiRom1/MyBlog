## Design Philosophy

### Balance Considerations

**Single Dino Abilities** focus on:
- Individual tactical decisions
- Risk/reward mechanics
- Specialized roles and counters
- Timing-based gameplay

**All Team Abilities** focus on:
- Strategic team building
- Coordination rewards
- Meta-game considerations
- Long-term battle dynamics

### Power Level Guidelines

- **Immediate effects**: Higher impact but shorter duration
- **Conditional effects**: Higher power when conditions are met
- **Permanent effects**: Lower individual impact but cumulative value
- **Cooldown abilities**: Higher power balanced by availability windows
