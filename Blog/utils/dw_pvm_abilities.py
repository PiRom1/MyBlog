DW PvM Abilities Implementation

This module implements advanced PvM abilities that require special mechanics
beyond simple stat modifications. These abilities are applied during battle
execution rather than in stat calculation.

Currently handles team abilities:
- "Dernier souffle": When an ally dies, others recover 20% HP immediately
- "Sprint préhistorique": +20% SPD to whole team for first 5 seconds of battle
- "Esprit de meute": +20% ATK if all allies alive, -10% otherwise
- "Bouclier collectif": 50% of damage received is shared among all other living allies
- "Instinct protecteur": +30% DEF for 2s when any team member takes a critical hit
- "Pression croissante": +5% ATK every 3 seconds
- "Seul contre tous": +25% all stats when only one dino remains alive
- "Terreur collective": +15% ATK permanently when an enemy dies
- "Mort-vivant": When the first dino dies, it continues attacking for 2s without being targetable

Individual dino abilities:
- "Frénésie": +25% attack speed when HP < 50%
- "Boureau": Probability-based instant kill based on target's remaining HP
- "Peau dure": 20% damage reduction when HP > 50%
- "Inspiration héroïque": +25% ATK for all allies for 1s on critical hit
- "Vol de vie": Heals attacker for 30% of damage dealt after each attack
- "Provocation": This dino is 2x more likely to be targeted by enemies
- "Agilitée accrue": 20% chance to dodge attacks when this dino is attacked
- "Regard pétrifiant": Always reduces target's speed by 25% for 3s after attacking
- "Régénération": Every 2 seconds, heals for 5% of maximum HP
- "Chasseur nocturne": 2x damage against enemies with poison/bleed
- "Carapace robuste": Starts at 50% damage reduction, decreases by 3% per hit (min -25%)
